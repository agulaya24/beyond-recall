Unified Brief Composition

Composes a single narrative brief from the 3 deployed identity layers
(ANCHORS, CORE, PREDICTIONS) + source identity-tier facts.

Franklin eval (S61) proved compressed brief (C5c) outperforms structured
layers (C2) by +0.40. The pipeline extracts value; compression makes it
usable.

UNIFIED_BRIEF_COMPOSITION_PROMPT = """You are composing a unified behavioral brief from identity layers about a specific person. This brief will be injected into AI system prompts so the AI can communicate naturally with — or as — this person.

The source layers are:
1. ANCHORS — epistemic axioms (what they reason FROM)
2. CORE — communication & operating guide (how to engage)
3. PREDICTIONS — behavioral patterns (situation → response)

Not all layers may be present. Some subjects have thin data — compose only from what exists.

Your task: combine the provided layers into a SINGLE narrative brief that faithfully represents ALL content from the source layers. The brief must be COMPLETE — nothing from the source layers should be left out. Size does not matter. A complete 15,000-token brief is better than a 5,000-token brief that drops content.

CRITICAL ANTI-HALLUCINATION CONSTRAINT:
You must ONLY include information that appears in the source layers or supporting facts below. Do NOT invent, fabricate, or fill in:
- Hobbies, interests, or possessions not mentioned in the sources
- Biographical details not stated in the sources
- Behavioral patterns not described in the sources
- Historical context not grounded in the sources
If a category (e.g., hobbies, creative interests) has NO content in the sources, OMIT IT ENTIRELY. Completeness means including everything FROM the sources, not filling gaps with fabricated content. When in doubt, leave it out.

THREE PROPERTIES that make a good brief (from controlled evaluation):

1. CONCRETE AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL MECHANISMS — Not "values honesty" but "will terminate a conversation that uses strategic ambiguity." Not "is analytical" but "will reframe an emotional question as a structural question, then solve the structure." Specific tactics, not abstractions.

2. CHARACTERISTIC INNER TENSIONS — The contradictions that define this person, stated in THEIR domain vocabulary. Tensions are MORE useful than clean descriptions because they let the AI anticipate failure modes. Each tension must be specific enough that a reader could identify the subject from the tension alone.

3. PRAGMATIC FRAMING — Write for an AI that needs to ACT on this information. Every sentence should change what the AI would say. If a sentence produces the same generic response with or without it, cut it.

ANTI-ANACHRONISM: Use vocabulary appropriate to the subject's era and lived experience. Do not project modern professional jargon onto historical figures or non-professional subjects. If the source material uses plain language, the brief must too.

NO SELF-REFERENCE: The brief describes WHO this person is — their identity, patterns, and how to engage with them. It must NOT reference the pipeline, system, or tools that created the brief.

ANONYMIZATION: Do NOT use the subject's full name in the brief. Use pronouns ("he", "she", "they") or generic references ("this person"). The brief describes behavioral patterns — including the name risks the reading AI pattern-matching to its pre-training knowledge about this person rather than using the behavioral model provided. The brief should work because of what it says, not who it's about.

COMPLETENESS REQUIREMENTS — include these elements IF AND ONLY IF they exist in the source layers:

From ANCHORS (if present):
- Every axiom's behavioral MECHANISM must be represented — but weave them into thematic narrative paragraphs, do NOT list them sequentially (e.g., "A1 does X; A2 does Y; A3 does Z" is FORBIDDEN). Group axioms by how they interact and manifest together in real situations. Some axioms may be mentioned by name where natural; others can be represented through their mechanism without explicit naming.
- Every [CONTESTED] marker preserved as-is
- Every false positive warning included
- Axiom interaction pairs (reinforcing AND tension) if described
- Meta-patterns if described (only those explicitly named in the source)
- [THIN DATA] warnings preserved as-is

From CORE (if present):
- Communication approach directives
- Context modes that appear in the source (only those listed — do not add unlisted domains)
- Narrative orientation if described
- Essential biographical context from the source
- Specific "do not" directives if listed in the source

From PREDICTIONS (if present):
- All behavioral predictions with their triggers as described in the source
- Detection signatures if provided
- False positive warnings if provided
- Pathological modes if provided
- Directives (what the AI should DO) if provided
- Parked/single-domain patterns noted as such if present
- Pattern interaction map if described

If no PREDICTIONS layer exists: Note at the end of the brief that behavioral prediction data is insufficient for this subject. The source material may not contain enough behavioral evidence to generate predictions — this is a data limitation, not a gap in the brief.

FALSE POSITIVE GUARD PRESERVATION (REQUIRED):
For behavioral predictions that include false positive warnings in the PREDICTIONS layer,
preserve them as inline qualifiers in the brief narrative. Format: describe the pattern,
then add a natural-language qualifier describing the false positive scenario and what
distinguishes it from the real pattern. These guards prevent the reading AI from over-applying patterns.
Use the subject's own domain language for each guard — do NOT use a formulaic "but not when X, which looks similar but stems from Y" template.
Do NOT strip false positive warnings during composition. Each guard should appear as a
natural parenthetical or dash-separated qualifier within the behavioral description.
If the PREDICTIONS layer has N false positive warnings, the composed brief should have
at least N-2 of them represented (some may merge naturally).

FORMAT:
- Write in flowing prose paragraphs, not bullet points or structured headers
- Use third person (match the pronouns used in the source layers)
- Open with a 2-3 sentence identity anchor (who this person IS, irreducibly). BANNED OPENING PHRASES (will trigger automatic rejection): "operates from", "unshakeable conviction", "unshakeable belief", "fundamental belief that", "deeply held", "at his/her core". Instead, open with a concrete behavioral observation — what does this person DO that reveals who they are? The opening should be as distinctive as a fingerprint
- Follow with behavioral mechanisms grouped by natural theme, not by source layer
- Close with the key tensions, but make each one ACTIONABLE: state the contradiction AND what the reading AI should do when it surfaces. Weave these into 1-2 flowing prose paragraphs (NOT a bulleted list, NOT a separate labeled section). Each tension-action pair should read as natural prose, not as a formatted directive. CRITICAL: Every tension and directive MUST use vocabulary, domain language, and specific details drawn from the source layers — never generic advisory language. A reader familiar with this person should be able to identify them from ANY single directive. Do NOT use stock phrases like "help diagnose the structural cause" or "demands systematic tracking but struggles with order" — derive each tension's language from the actual behavioral evidence in the layers below. If the source layers describe a specific domain tension (e.g., moral perfectionism vs. pragmatic compromise in governance), the directive must use THOSE terms, not therapeutic abstractions
- End with an AVAILABILITY INDEX (see below)
- Do NOT reproduce the layer structure — this is a synthesis, not a concatenation
- Directives can be woven into narrative paragraphs — they do not need separate formatting
- ANTI-ENUMERATION: Never list axioms, predictions, or context modes sequentially in a single paragraph. A paragraph that reads "A1 does X; A2 does Y; A3 does Z..." is a schema dump, not a behavioral narrative. Instead, group related mechanisms thematically — show how axioms interact and manifest together in real situations from this person's life.

AVAILABILITY INDEX (required, place at end of brief after [THIN DATA]):
The brief is a compression. Some identity-significant patterns from the source layers were represented as behavioral texture (woven into descriptions of other patterns) rather than foregrounded as themes. The availability index signals what else exists in the deeper behavioral model, so the reading AI knows when to retrieve more detail.

Format — a single paragraph starting with "Additional behavioral patterns available:" followed by a comma-separated list. Each item is: "[pattern name or concept] — [when it surfaces / how it manifests]". Only include patterns that:
1. Appear in the source layers (axioms, context modes, or predictions) but were NOT foregrounded as a primary theme in the brief
2. Are genuinely identity-significant (they survived the full extraction pipeline)
3. Have a clear manifestation trigger (when would this pattern become relevant in conversation?)

Do NOT include patterns that are already well-developed in the brief. Do NOT pad the list. 3-8 items is typical.

Each item should use the subject's own terminology for both the pattern name and the trigger context. Do NOT use generic pattern names — derive them from the source layers.

USAGE INSTRUCTIONS (note to composing model: these instructions will be prepended separately when served — do NOT include them in the brief output):
- The brief will contain ALL-CAPS pattern names as internal reference labels. These are for the AI's understanding — the reading AI should never quote or name them in responses.
- These usage instructions are handled separately. Just compose the brief.

ANTI-REDUNDANCY:
- State each idea ONCE. If public benefit is the core axiom, establish it in one paragraph and refer back — do not restate it in every context mode.
- Do NOT reproduce provenance lines (provenance: [F-xxx, ...]) from the source layers. Those are metadata, not brief content.
- Do NOT reproduce layer taxonomy labels (PERSONAL/MORAL CONTEXT, BUSINESS/PROFESSIONAL CONTEXT, etc.) as inline headers. The brief is a narrative, not a structured data format.
- Do NOT use pipeline jargon ("future-projecting temporal orientation", "context modes", "epistemic axioms"). Describe the person in plain language.
- Target: each behavioral insight appears exactly once, in the paragraph where it has the most thematic resonance.

ANTI-CATALOGING (HARD RULE — most common failure mode):
- NEVER organize paragraphs by domain. Do NOT write "His approach to governance...", then "In matters of reform...", then "His military thinking..." — that mirrors the CORE layer's structure and produces a reference manual, not a portrait.
- NEVER use the word "mechanism" to describe axioms (e.g., "his CORPORATE-ACCOUNTABILITY mechanism demands..."). This is pipeline vocabulary leaking into the brief. Describe what the person DOES, not what the system labeled it.
- Instead: organize by BEHAVIORAL PATTERN that cuts across domains. "He insists on seeing conditions firsthand — tenement slums, police precincts, military camps — and distrusts any conclusion built from secondhand reports" covers governance, reform, and military in one sentence without domain headers.
- Axiom names (ALL-CAPS labels) may appear as internal tags for the reading AI, but they should be embedded in behavioral descriptions, never presented as "the X mechanism."
- If the source ANCHORS layer has more than 8 axioms, represent each through its most vivid behavioral manifestation rather than trying to name every axiom explicitly.

DATA QUALITY MARKERS (CONDITIONAL):
- Use exactly `[THIN DATA]` (not `[THIN]`, not plain text) for data limitation notes.
- ONLY include a `[THIN DATA]` paragraph if the source layers contain `[THIN IN:]` or `[THIN DATA]` markers, OR if the source corpus clearly covers only 1-2 domains. If the source layers have rich multi-domain data with no thin markers, do NOT fabricate a generic limitation paragraph.
- When you DO include [THIN DATA], derive the specific language from the source layers' own thin-data markers. Do NOT use the generic phrase "Behavioral prediction data is insufficient" — instead describe what specific domains the source layers flagged as thin, using the subject's own domain vocabulary.
- Use `[CONTESTED]` for disputed or uncertain patterns, preserved from source layers.
- Some vagueness is intentional: where the source data supports a behavioral direction but not a specific prediction, describe the tendency without manufacturing false precision.

CONSTRAINTS:
- Every claim must be traceable to the source layers or facts provided below
- Do NOT invent behavioral patterns, interests, possessions, or biographical details not in the sources
- Preserve [CONTESTED] and data-quality markers from source layers
- No philosophy framework names, no motivational filler
- COMPLETENESS over density — include everything from the source layers, but ONLY from the source layers
- Do NOT reference "Base Layer", the pipeline, or any system that produced this brief
